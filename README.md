# Modelling the Transport of Microplastics in the Ocean
The purpose of this project is to model the movement of microplastic particles in ocean waves. To do this, we have employed object-oriented
programming and implemented the non-dimensional Maxey-Riley equation, using the `integrate.solve_ivp()` function from SciPy's `integrate`
library to evaluate the equation. Using this as our foundation, we can generate various visualisations of the data generated by our model.

## Project Description
Plastic pollution in the global oceans has been a growing issue over the course of the past several decades. Specifically, the effects of microplastics,
or plastic particles smaller than 5mm in diameter, have been of special concern in marine environments. Scientists have observed a size-dependent movement
of microplastics from the ocean surface to the water column, but have not yet developed a full understanding of the mechanism behind this process. To
further the existing understanding of the movement of these particles, researchers are working to model the movement of microplastics in the global oceans
using the Maxey-Riley equation. However, existing models only account for cases of deep water and/or cases with microplastic particles that are
sufficiently small. We examine previous work done to model this process using the non-dimensional Maxey-Riley equation, and seek to increase the
robustness of existing models by employing more general solutions for the velocity field and the Stokes drift velocity, and including the
Basset-Boussinesq history term.

## Project Organization
The source code for this project is contained in the `transport_framework`, `models`, and `examples` directories. The `transport_framework` directory
defines the `Particle`, `Flow`, and `TransportSystem` objects in general. The `models` directory contains specific implementations of these objects (ex:
`models/santamaria_system.py` is the implementation of the transport system described in Santamaria et al. (2013)). The `examples` directory contains
examples of how the implementations in `models` can be used. The `figures` directory contains plots produced from `examples`, as well as relevant figures
from other sources. Documentation for the source code can be found in the `docs` directory.
