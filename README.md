# Modelling the Transport of Microplastics in the Ocean
The purpose of this project is to model the movement of microplastic particles in ocean waves. To do this, we have employed object-oriented
programming and implemented the Maxey-Riley equation using two methods: the `integrate.solve_ivp()` function from SciPy's `integrate`
library, and the quadrature scheme outlined in [Daitche (2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2013.07.024). Using this as our foundation,
we can generate various visualisations of the data generated by our model.

## Project Description
Plastic pollution in the global oceans has been a growing issue in recent decades. Specifically, the effects of microplastics,
or plastic particles smaller than 5mm in diameter, have been of special concern in marine environments. Scientists have observed a size-dependent movement
of microplastics from the ocean surface to the water column, but have not yet developed a full understanding of the mechanism behind this process. To
further the existing understanding of the movement of these particles, researchers are working to model the movement of microplastics in the global oceans
using the Maxey-Riley equation. However, existing models only account for cases of deep water and/or cases with microplastic particles that are
sufficiently small. We examine previous work done to model this process using the Maxey-Riley equation, and seek to increase the
robustness of existing models by employing more general solutions for the velocity field and the Stokes drift velocity, and including the
Basset-Boussinesq history term.

## Project Organization
The source code for this project is contained in the `transport_framework`, `models`, and `examples` directories. The [`transport_framework`](transport_framework)
directory defines the `Particle`, `Flow`, and `TransportSystem` objects in general. The [`models`](models) directory contains specific implementations of these
objects (ex: [`models/santamaria_system.py`](models/santamaria_system.py) is the implementation of the transport system described in [Santamaria et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/102/14003)). The [`examples`](examples) directory contains examples of how the implementations in `models` can be used. The [`figures`](figures) directory contains plots
produced from `examples`, as well as relevant figures from other sources. Documentation for the source code can be found in the [`docs`](docs) directory.
For a visual representation of the code structure, see the [UML diagram](figures/UML_diagram.png).
