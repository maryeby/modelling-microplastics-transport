Dear reader,

please be aware that changing the parameters related to the time grid, i.e. "tini", "tend", "nt", MAY require a recalculation of the matrix values to ensure convergence of the nonlinear solver.

This is automatically done by the ToolBox by deleting the a00_MATRX_VALUES.txt file.

In short: if you encounter problems with the convergence of the solver, try to delete the other .txt file and run the script again.

Have fun!
